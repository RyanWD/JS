<p><i id="quoteMarkL" class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i> The Grand Master of science fiction and great popularizer of science, Isaac Asimov was born in Russia in 1920 and grew up in the USA. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He gained his doctorate in chemistry in 1949. His first story was published in 1939 in the magazine <em>Amazing stories</em> and he went on to write nearly five hundred books and several hundred articles on various subjects. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mysteries, histories of science, encyclopaedias, textbooks and a two-volume autobiography. He died in 1992. <i id="quoteMarkR" class="fas fa-quote-right fa-2x"></i>
